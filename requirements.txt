Part 2: Main Exercise
–
AI Office Hours Helper Goal
Build and deploy a small web app that converts a freeform workflow pain point into a structured action plan.
The app should:
Accept user input
Generate a structured plan
Display the plan in both human-readable and raw JSON formats

Functional Requirements
Your solution is considered complete when it:

1.Accepts freeform text input describing a workflow problem
2. Calls an API endpoint when the user clicks Generate Plan
3. Produces a response that matches the required schema
4. Displays: A readable view of the plan The raw JSON output
5. Handles:Loading states Empty input API or validation errors
6. Is deployed to Netlify with a public URL

A GitHub repo link is optional but encouraged.
Required Output Schema
The API must return an object with the following shape:

{
"problem_statement": "string",
"clarifying_questions":["string"],
"proposed_approach":["string"],
"recommended_tools":["string"],
"risks_and_privacy":["string"],
"next_steps":["string"]
}

Schema Rules
clarifying_questions : 3–5 items
proposed_approach : 4–7 items
risks_and_privacy : at least 1 item
next_steps : actionable verbs (for example: “Define…”, “Review…”, “Prototype…”)


Expected UI View
Problem Statement
Clarifying Questions ( bulleted list)
Proposed Approach ( bulleted list)
Recommended Tools (list or tags)
Risks & Privacy ( bulleted list)
Next Steps (checklist)
Implementation Guidance
API Requirement
The Generate Plan button must call an API endpoint (Netlify Function preferred).
You may implement the API in one of two ways:

Option A: Real LLM
Call an LLM API
Validate the response against the required schema
